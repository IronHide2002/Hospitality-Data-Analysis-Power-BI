# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - PowerBI

## Project Overview

This project was created as part of the [Codebasics Resume Project Challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge). The goal of this project was to help **Atliq Grands**, a luxury hotel chain in India, regain its market share and revenue by incorporating **Business and Data Intelligence**. 

The management of Atliq Grands lacked in-house data analytics capabilities, so the task was to use their historical data to generate insights and present them via an interactive dashboard. This dashboard would serve as a foundation for more informed decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Atliq Grands has been in the hospitality business for over 20 years but has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to increased competition and ineffective management decisions. The **Revenue Management Team** hired external data analysts to provide insights into their performance and guide future strategy.

## Task List

1. **Create Metrics:** Develop key metrics as outlined by the stakeholders.
2. **Design Dashboard:** Build an interactive dashboard to visualize data based on the provided mock-up.
3. **Generate Insights:** Provide relevant data insights beyond the metrics specified in the mock-up.

## Key Insights from the Analysis

- **Mumbai** generates the highest revenue at **669 Million**, followed by **Bangalore**, **Hyderabad**, and **Delhi**.
- **AtliQ Exotica** is the best-performing property with a revenue of **320 Million**, a rating of **3.62**, **57% occupancy**, and a **24.4% cancellation rate**.
